 **I programmed this game in two parts.**

- Part 1: A basic, functioning TicTacToe game for two players, or for 1 player. However, the AI is primitive and only makes random moves.

- Part 2: Making the AI unbeatable by using the minimax algorithim.

## Ways to improve the project

- Improving the user interface and making it a bit easier to read (Done)

- A lot of work can be done to extract methods instead of duplicating code in multiple places (Done)

- Could also make a board class seperately. (Done)
